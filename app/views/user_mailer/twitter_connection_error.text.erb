Hi <%= @user.email %>,

Feedbin has lost the ability to connect to Twitter on your behalf. This means that Twitter subscriptions you have in Feedbin cannot be updated.

You can grant access again on: <%= settings_newsletters_pages_url %>

Please ignore this message if this was done intentionally. You will not receive any more.

Thanks!
